      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <p> When I meet new people or apply to a job, I often end up telling my life’s story. I often get told that it is inspiring to hear because I chose an unconventional and courageous path. I don’t mind telling the story over and over again, but at some point I decided to write it all down and share it publicly so that everyone may benefit from my experiences and insights. If you’re looking for a summary, go to my Twitter or LinkedIn or check out my CV [insert link]. This is the full story. Very, very, very few people will enjoy reading it. If you are one of them, I am doing it, first and foremost, for you. Second, I am doing it because some day more people might care and then I don’t want someone else to attempt to make sense of my life. And third, I do it for myself because I enjoy structuring, expressing and debating my thoughts. Writing them down makes that easier.
