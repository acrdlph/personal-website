// (without distorting the slope) in order to circumvent the problem that Bancor formula doesn't work when supply and reserve equal 0.

  // first approach (for most cases, because usually curves start flat): 
  // A. set vReserve to the smallest acceptable value which is 1 (= 1 x fullERC20 token/10^18)
  // B. set vSupply to the token amount which if bought would have led to that reserve being in the contract
  // (again expressed in granular units of fullERC20/10^18)
  let vReserve = 1;
  let vSupply = (((n+1)/(m*10**18))^(1/(n+1)))*10**18; // this can be reverse calculated by setting the integral of a mx^n function to 1 with the appropriate decimals
  // but if the curve is very steep, the token amount needed to get 1 unit of reserve could be smaller than 1!
  // then we need to go the other way around:
  // A) set the virtual token amount to the smallest possible acceptable value namely 1
  // B) calculate the corresponding reserve, which will necessarily be bigger than 1 since the price function is always increasing (m>0):
  // if (vSupply < 1) {
  //   vSupply = 1;
  //   vReserve = (m/(n+1))*(1/10**18)^(n+1);
